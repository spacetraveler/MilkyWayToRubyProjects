# The Milky Way to Ruby projects.

Our mission dives into the space of unidentified development processes.
Various models arch across the software galaxy, abstracting actual patterns of thought within individual approaches. 

SpaceTraveler launched <a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2120457/MilkyWayToRuby"> this survey </a> to document and share the phases and tools you – dear anonymous
rubynaut – touch during your project journey. GitHub, we have a problem ...err question.

Prospectively, submitted records will be reviewed and turned into a visualization – imagine a sky of blinking development processes. Its inherent star constellations may help the curious onlooker to navigate future software ventures.

Please, stay put(s).
